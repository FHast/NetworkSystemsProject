==== Welcome to the Ubuntu live USB ====

This live environment has been slightly modified for UTwente. 
This system includes Wireshark and several other tools that might be helpfull to you!
If you would like to install linux on your system you can either use the installation option in the application menu or download a 'fresh' distribution from the internet. While we try to keep this environment up to date we are not always on the latest release!
